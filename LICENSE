Copyright © \ 2025 \ Johnson Jason

This license governs the use, modification, distribution, and publication of the MateEngine software and any works derived from it. By using this software, you agree to the following terms:

---

### 1. **Grant of Use and Modification**

You are granted the right to use, study, modify, and distribute the MateEngine source code and any derivative works, under the conditions below.

---

### 2. **Source Code Disclosure Requirement (Copyleft)**

If you:

* modify the MateEngine source code,
* include it within another application,
* run it as part of a service accessible to others (e.g., multiplayer servers, cloud apps),
* or create a derivative work,

then you **must make the complete, corresponding source code** of your version **publicly available** under the same license. This includes:

* All modified files.
* Any interface code or components required to build and run your version.
* If deployed as a service, the source code corresponding to the running version.

The source must be hosted on a **freely accessible public platform** (such as GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, or similar) with no paywall or login required to view or download it.

### 2A. **Use as a Library or Engine (Modding Clause)**

You are permitted to use MateEngine as a library or engine to create games, mods, or applications, including by dynamically linking to it or embedding it.

However, the following conditions apply:

* If your project **includes, modifies, or statically links** MateEngine source code, it is considered a **derivative work** and must follow all terms of this license (see Sections 2 and 3).
* If your project **only uses MateEngine as a library** (e.g., via dynamic linking or scripting interfaces), and does **not reuse full classes or methods** of MateEngine directly, then:

  * You may license your project under any license you choose,
  * **But you must make your project open-source and provide a link to a public code repository (e.g., GitHub)**,
  * And you must not misrepresent your project as being officially affiliated with or endorsed by the MateEngine project.
* In all cases, your project must be **non-commercial** and comply with the no-sell restriction (see Section 6).

---

### 3. **Redistribution Conditions**

Redistribution of MateEngine or derivative works is allowed under the following conditions:

* It must be under the **MateEngine Pro License**.
* It must be **free of charge**.
* The complete source code must be made publicly available as outlined in section 2.
* Attribution to the original MateEngine authors must be preserved.

---

### 4. **Modding and Third-Party Platform Publication**

You may create **mods, extensions, or plugins** for MateEngine and publish them on third-party platforms such as:

* **Steam / Steam Workshop**
* **itch.io**
* **ModDB**
* or similar platforms,

**provided that**:

* The mod or extension is **open-source** and the complete source code is published and linked (e.g., on GitHub).
* The mod is **free of charge** to users.
* The mod includes a notice that it is a modification of MateEngine and retains this license if it uses any MateEngine source code.

---

### 5. **External Works**

If your work **does not modify or include** any MateEngine source code (i.e., it is fully external and interacts only via public APIs or interfaces), you may license your work under any terms you wish, **provided** that:

* You do not reuse or copy entire classes, functions, or methods from MateEngine.
* You do not misrepresent your work as being officially affiliated with or endorsed by the MateEngine project.

---

### 6. **Commercial Use**

You **may not**:

* Sell MateEngine or any derivative, fork, or modified version.
* Monetize any project that includes or modifies MateEngine source code.
* Offer paid access to services running MateEngine without making your full source code publicly available under this license.

**Commercial use of external, independent mods** (that do not include MateEngine source code) is allowed **only if** MateEngine code is not reused.

---

### 7. **No Warranty**

MateEngine is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

---

### 8. **Termination**

Any breach of this license automatically terminates your rights to use, modify, or distribute MateEngine and any derivative works.
